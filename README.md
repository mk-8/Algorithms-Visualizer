# Algorithms Visualization

## 🚀 Demo

Check out the live demo [here]() to explore the algorithms in action.

## 🌐 Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## 📖 Project Overview

This project provides an interactive platform for visualizing and experimenting with various algorithms related to deadlock, concurrency, and process scheduling. It is designed to help users understand the behavior of these algorithms in real-time through visual simulation.

### 🔒 Deadlock and Concurrency with Semaphores

Explore and interact with different algorithms used to handle deadlocks and manage concurrency using semaphores. The algorithms included are:

1. **Banker's Algorithm**
2. **Lock Variable**
3. **Test & Set Lock**
4. **Strict Alteration**
5. **Peterson's Algorithm**
6. **Producer & Consumer Problem**
7. **Binary Semaphore**
8. **Counting Semaphore**

### 🕒 Scheduling Algorithms

You can also visualize and interact with 9 different process scheduling algorithms, allowing you to see how tasks are prioritized and executed in various scenarios:

1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
3. **Longest Job First (LJF)**
4. **Round Robin (RR)**
5. **Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF)**
6. **Longest Remaining Job First (LRJF)**
7. **Priority Preemptive**
8. **Priority Non-Preemptive**
9. **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)**
