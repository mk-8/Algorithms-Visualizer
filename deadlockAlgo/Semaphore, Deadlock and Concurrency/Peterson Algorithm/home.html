  <h1 id="midd">Peterson's Algorithm</h1>
  <p id="def">Petersonâ€™s solution provides a good algorithmic description of solving the critical-section problem and illustrates some of the complexities involved in designing software that addresses the requirements of mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting.
    Peterson's algorithm is considered a standard low-level algorithm for two-thread mutual exclusion.

                    1.Mutual Exclusion<br/>
                    The method described ensures mutual exclusion by using a condition in the entry section that involves two variables. This setup prevents a process from entering the critical section unless the other process is not interested and it was the last to update the turn variable. This approach effectively coordinates access to the critical section, ensuring that only one process can enter at a time, thus maintaining mutual exclusion. <br/>
                    <br>2.Progress<br/>
                    An uninterested process will never prevent another interested process from entering the critical section. If both processes are interested, the process will wait.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    3.Bounded waiting<br/>
                    The interested variable mechanism failed because it did not provide bounded waiting. However, in Peterson's solution, a deadlock can never occur because the process that first sets the turn variable will definitely enter the critical section. Therefore, if a process is preempted after executing line 4 of the entry section, it will certainly enter the critical section on its next opportunity.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    4.Portability<br/>
                    This is a comprehensive software solution, making it portable across all hardware platforms.
